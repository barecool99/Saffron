                 The Garlic Chilli Chicken Masala with Tarka Dal side was to die for! Warming, with a wonderful garlic kick & a chilli bite! The Dal was 
                 the perfect accompaniment! Tandoori mix with Paneer paratha, was a match made in heaven. Very tasty & moorish - the bread was absolutely beautiful.
Not as expensive as we thought it may have been, just over £20. 
Ordered in advance by phone, for collection. 
Saffron Indian Restaurant, you deserve to be higher up the trip advisor list. If you like good Indian food, then don’t walk past this place."

    " Not our first visit or my first review. However I believe it is important to review each visit if th
                e experience changes for worse or better.. Yet again this restaurant has exceeded all expectation, food 
                gets better with every visit and service that supports that culinary experience. Brilliant food, outstanding menu and a dining experience that we can enjoy as a family at a reasonable cost... Looking forward to our next visit already
                . Thanks team Saffron!"

                "This is now officially my favourite Restaurant on the North Coast. I have had numerous takeaways and quite a few sit in meals.
                 Food is of a really high standard and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. Initially this was a bring your own alcohol Restaurant but they have just recently obtained a license.
                  My sister used to live in Birmingham and is a connoisseur of 
                 When I brought her to Saffron for a meal she stated that it was one of the best Indians she had had.
                  Long may this restaurant grace the North Coast for without it we would be all the poorer."
